I am a Web Developer. I save companies thousands of hours and dollars automating repetive website management tasks. 

Professional Achievements

-- revamped their workflow to be more fluid and rebust, allowing for multiple web developers and multiple features to be concurrently developed, tested, visually tested in a staging environment before commiting to the code that is to be pushed to production. Additionally negated the possibility of pushes to live production server crashing through building a new standardizated sequence of dev to production procedures.
