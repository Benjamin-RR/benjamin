                Hands down would be my expierience at <a href="https://vksapp.com" target="_blank">VKS</a>. Their website was going through growth pains, where their demand was out performing the tech stack's capabilities. I was given project ownership of "Website Stability" in which I led research, architecture design, development, deligated tasks to team members, load/stress tested systems, navigating both frontend and backend frameworks while also taking it upon myself to revamp their web development work flow, mitigating merge conflicts by over 90% in a team based work environment, and completely eliminating all production push crashes by 100% while simultaneously improving their file folder management system creating a new standardization of development practices for all web developers which increased productivity by a factor of 3.

                What Am I Currently Working On?
            </h3>
            <p>
                My projects are many. From projects on web3 blockchain technologies, automating routine tasks, to roguelike video games. Currently I am investing more time in my Youtube bots that can self research, record, and post videos. It notifies me when it posts or fails to post a video, and will give a social media post of the new youtube video once it goes live. I am constantly developing, and love the creative freedom this industry gives. The possibilities are endless.
